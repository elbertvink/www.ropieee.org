While RoPieee is a great solution for Raspberry Pi DIY environments, it might not be for commercial audio equipment.
First of all RoPieee is not certified by Roon(tm) and as such not Roon Ready(tm). This means only the very basic integration is possible, where as Roon Ready(tm) certification also takes care of showing your device in the Roon interface, providing awesome integration features!

Luckily it's possible to get a commercial implementation from our main-sponsor Baseflow. 
[Baseflow](https://baseflow.com) is a software development company specialised in Roon implementations. This means Baseflow takes care of the software and the certification process from Roon.
The result is an audio device that's Roon Ready as soon as it hits the market, with support and upgrade path.
